In this chapter the detector is tested, first with a toy example and then with actual
radiomic data provided by the VHIO. 

\section{A toy example}
Let's test the detector with a toy dataset, which can be seen in \cref{fig:clusters}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering \small \sffamily
	\input{figs/plots/clusters.pgf}
	\caption{Custom point cloud to illustrate the working of the detector. This set has two
	clusters, the orange and purple points; and two outliers, the green and blue points.}
	\label{fig:clusters}
\end{figure}
This dataset has two large clusters and two clear outliers, which we expect to be able to
detect. The result of running the detector with this set can be seen in \cref{fig:toy
results}. The labels are such that each individual point can be identified in the
persistence diagram (the point labeled as \( n \) in \cref{fig:toy results} is the
lifetime and size of the point labeled as \( n \) in \cref{fig:clusters}). 
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering \small \sffamily
	\input{figs/plots/test-persistence.pgf}
	\caption{The result of running the detector on the point cloud of \cref{fig:clusters}.
		Both outliers are clearly visible as such, since they lie in the lower right of the
	plot, as is to be expected.}
	\label{fig:toy results}
\end{figure}
On the lower left we see a lot of orange and purple dots. These reflect the fact that in
the early stages of the filtration, most of the classes in the clusters will quickly merge
with their neighbours so they never reach large sizes. Then, once the two main clusters
have become connected, no more deaths happen for some time. Then, roughly at the halfway
point of the filtration, both outliers get absorbed into the two main clusters, as the
blue and green dots represent. Then we see the death of the orange cluster as it merges
into the purple cluster. In this situation, it makes sense that both outliers are absorbed
first, since they are closer to the main clusters than the two main clusters are to each
other. Finally, the purple cluster dies as the filtration ends, having absorbed every
point. 

\section{A test with real radiomic signatures}
A preliminary study of TOPiomics was an investigation into which radiomic features
extracted from a lung tumour scan are best correlated to the response to a certain
treatment \cite{features}. Out of the whole range of features computed by
\textsf{PyRadiomics}, 26 were found to have the highest correlation. The data from this
study was kindly provided by VHIO to test the detector. It consists of the radiomic
signature of 20 patients, as well as data related to the their genomics. The detector was
run on both the radiomic and genomic feature spaces to see if there is a relationship
between the clustering structure in both. The results can be seen in
\cref{fig:rad,fig:gen}. Points labeled with the same number represent the same patient. 
\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering \small \sffamily
	\input{figs/plots/rad-26.pgf}
	\caption{The clustering information obtained from the outlier detector on the test
	radiomic data.}
	\label{fig:rad}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering \small \sffamily
	\input{figs/plots/gen-26.pgf}
	\caption{The clustering information obtained from the outlier detector on the test
	genomic data.}
	\label{fig:gen}
\end{figure}

In the radiomic feature space we see a lot of clustering early on, and then a large
cluster (12) which dies halfway through. This seems to indicate two main clusters. However no
clear outliers can be seen. In the genomic space the situation is somewhat similar, with
again a lot of clustering early on and a somewhat large cluster (12) that dies a little later,
which again seems to indicate two main clusters. We also see a very clear outlier (6),
that is not absorbed into the main cluster until the very end of the filtration. 9 could
also be seen as an outlier, since it is absorbed into the main cluster after 12, but it
does not persist for very long.

\section{Conclusions}
As can be seen from the results from the test run, it appears that the detector is
successful in providing a way to evaluate which points are outliers and which measure. The
results from the run on the clinical data have been sent back to VHIO for their input on
what is their clinical significance, if any. 

There are three main points related to further work on the project:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item First there is the question of the efficiency of the program. Some trial runs
		suggested that the runtime does not scale well with the number of points nor the
		ambient dimension. It appears the main bottleneck is the building of the filtration.
		As mentioned before, there are ways to optimise this process (see \cite{tidyset}). 
	\item There is also the question of the robustness of the detector: how well does it
		perform with certain edgecases. Two factors seem to be important: the diameter of the
		clusters and the distance between them. The detector could be stress tested with
		various combinations of these two values. 
	\item Finally, the detector only uses information gathered from the zeroth homology
		group. Since the dimension of the spaces we are dealing with is high, the homology
		groups of higher dimension could be exploited somehow. 
\end{enumerate}
